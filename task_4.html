      <li>
        <b>< div ></b>: It's like a container that allows you to group and style
        content together. It doesn't have any specific meaning on its own but is
        essential for organizing and structuring content. Developers use the <
        div > tag along with CSS to apply styles, positioning, and formatting to
        sections of a webpage, making it a versatile tool for creating layouts
        and structuring content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>< p > </b>: The < p > tag in HTML is used to create paragraphs. It
        defines a block of text, and when you use this tag, the browser
        automatically adds spacing before and after the paragraph. It's a basic
        element for structuring and displaying text content on a webpage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>< img ></b> : In HTML, the < img > tag is self-closing and doesn't
        require a closing < / > tag. It's used to insert images into a webpage.
        If you want to use the < img > tag, it should look like this: < img
        >src="image.jpg" alt="Description">. There's no need for a closing tag
        as you'd use with other elements like paragraphs < p > or divs < div >.
      </li>
      <li><b>< a ></a></b>:The <a> tag in HTML creates hyperlinks. It's used to link to other web pages or content. Its href attribute defines the destination, allowing users to click and navigate to the specified address. For example: < a  href="https://www.example.com">Link Text< / > creates a clickable link showing "Link Text" that leads to the specified website when clicked.
