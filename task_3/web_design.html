        Web design is the process of creating visually appealing and functional
        websites. It involves the arrangement of elements, colors, and content
        to ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience. Designers focus on
        aesthetics, usability, and accessibility, working closely with
        developers to bring their designs to life using various coding
        languages. The goal is to craft websites that are both visually
        attractive and user-friendly, adapting to the evolving needs of
        businesses and users.
